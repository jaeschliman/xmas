auto reload textures.
this could be done by having a queue on the texture manager that
accepts texture updates, and running a dedicated thread that montiors
the FS for image changes.
----------------------------------------
behavior trees (at some point)
----------------------------------------
have a dedicated sketch-like macro, where re-evaluating
're-loads' the sketch, something like
(defscene my-scene
  :vars
  player (sprite-from-file "./foo.png")
  enemy (sprite-from-file "./bar.png)
  bullets (make-array 0 :adjustable t :fill-pointer 0)
  :on-enter
  (set-music "./scary.mp3")
  (add-child self player) ; implicit var self
  (add-child self enemy)
  :update
  ;; etc etc
  (move-bullets bullets dt) ; implicit vars bullets and dt
  (when (key-down #\Space) (shoot-bullet player bullets)))

(run-scene 'my-scene)
;; and hereafter when re-evaluating the defscene,
;; the runtime will restart the scene in its window
;; if it is running
----------------------------------------
handle errors in the drawing code better.
currently if a drawing instruction throws an exception
we'll usually wind up with a stack overflow as gl matrices
will not be popped.
